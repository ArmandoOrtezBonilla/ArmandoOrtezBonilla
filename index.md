# Armando Ortez  
**Bioengineering (B.S.) · Applied Epidemiology (Minor)**  
Temple University

Hi! I’m Armando Ortez. I’m a bioengineering student focused on translational research at the intersection of biomaterials,mechanobiology and public health. I continue to build skills, in data analysis, scientific communication and translation, as I prepare for a career in medicine, and biomedical research.

I am currently enrolled in Fundamental of Geogrpahic Systems, where I am developing skills in spatial analysis, mapping, and data visualization. This website was created as part of that course to document and showcase applied GIS work alongside my broader academic and research efforts.

This site is **preliminary** and will continue to grow into a more **robust academic and professional portfolio**.
