*Fundamentals of Geographic Information Systems*

This page represents my work over the course of the semester, highlighting three maps that demonstrate my ability to solve problems and create narratives using Geographic Information Systems analysis, software, and framework. This semester, I primarily used ARCGIS Pro, a software in the class that essentially creates these visual maps. At the beginning of the course, I did not think I would use this, but at the end of the semester, I had used maps of Chronic Kidney Disease for my problem statements and relevance to society for senior design. Additionally, it can be used for multiple applications that are not solely based on health, but also supply chain, housing costs, where to live, and where to start a family. These are some examples, but there is more to the field of geographic information systems. Overall, I did enjoy the use of the maps. I wish I could have been more present in the processes instead of rushing, but overall, it was a great use for other applications, I never even thought of. As an engineering student, this adds depth to my skills as a prospective graduate student or employee.

### Narrative 

The map shown in Figure 1 depcits Pennslyvania voter tunrout and the percentage concentration of voters by politcal party, based on which party was leading in each distrcit. The primary purpose of the map is to illustrate that politcal parties are geograpically loclaized and vary across the state, with differing levels of concentration and vary across the state, with differing levels of concentration by district. Additionally, the map highlights how poltical idealogies are favored differently across regions. Importantly, the map should not be interpreted as potrayting poltical homogeniety within distrcits. This aligns with the concept of the ecological fallacy, in which a single dominant narrative is incorrectly used to judge all individuals within an area. Instead, the intepretation should acknowledge the muiltiple social and political dyanmics that exist within each district. This perspective helps shifts mindsets away from viewing areas as uniformaly Democratic or Republic.
