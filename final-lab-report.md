*Fundamentals of Geographic Information Systems*

This page represents my work over the course of the semester, highlighting three maps that demonstrate my ability to solve problems and create narratives using Geographic Information Systems analysis, software, and framework. This semester, I primarily used ARCGIS Pro, a software in the class that essentially creates these visual maps. At the beginning of the course, I did not think I would use this, but at the end of the semester, I had used maps of Chronic Kidney Disease for my problem statements and relevance to society for senior design. Additionally, it can be used for multiple applications that are not solely based on health, but also supply chain, housing costs, where to live, and where to start a family. These are some examples, but there is more to the field of geographic information systems. Overall, I did enjoy the use of the maps. I wish I could have been more present in the processes instead of rushing, but overall, it was a great use for other applications, I never even thought of. As an engineering student, this adds depth to my skills as a prospective graduate student or employee.

Map 1 — 2020 Presidential Election Results (Pennsylvania)
<img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/map1.jpg" width="900">




Narrative 

The map shown in Figure 1 depcits Pennslyvania voter tunrout and the percentage concentration of voters by politcal party, based on which party was leading in each district. The primary purpose of the map is to illustrate that politcal parties are geograpically localized and vary across the state, with differing levels of concentration and vary across the state, with differing levels of concentration by district. Additionally, the map highlights how poltical idealogies are favored differently across regions. Importantly, the map should not be interpreted as potrayting poltical homogeniety within distrcits. This aligns with the concept of the ecological fallacy, in which a single dominant narrative is incorrectly used to judge all individuals within an area. Instead, the intepretation should acknowledge the muiltiple social and political dyanmics that exist within each district. This perspective helps shifts mindsets away from viewing areas as uniformaly Democratic or Republic.

## Map 2 — Homicide Density by Police District (Chicago)

<p><em><strong>Figure 2.</strong> Homicide density by police district in Chicago with individual homicide locations overlaid.</em></p>

Narrative
Figure 2 illustrates the spatial distribution of homicide density across Chicago police districts, revealing clear geographic clustering rather than a uniform pattern across the city. With higher homicide densities concentrated in certain districts towards the west of Chicago, East Chicago has less crime, therefore more expensive Airbnb and tourism rates in those areas. In addition, large portions of Chicago exhibit comparatively low rates. This spatial visualization challenges the notion of the presidential candidates ' opinion on Chicago having a higher homicide rate. By visualizing homicide density per square mile, the map demonstrates the crime is localized and that citywide generalization obscures meaningful spatial differences within districts.

Map 3 — Philadelphia Schools and Bike Network

<p><em><strong>Figure 3.</strong> Philadelphia School District schools with enrollments over 1,200 students located within 0.1 miles of the city bike network.</em></p>

### Narrative:

Figure 3 showcases how geographic data can be the central problem to identify neighborhoods in Piadlpehia that contain large public schools, which are well connected to the city's bike network. To address this, school enrollment data nd bike network data were analyzed together to move beyond the tabular format, and understand how location influences accessibility. By filtering schools with enrollments greater than 1,200 students and examining their proximity to bike infrastructure, the analysis revealed that only a small number of schools meet both criteria. Mapping these results showed that well-connected, high-enrollment schools are spread across different neighborhoods, rather than clustered in one area. This narrative demonstrates how GIS allows data from multiple data sources to be combined, interpreted, and visualized in a way that supports informed decision-making about transportation and access and urban planning. This spatial visualization helps education leaders, parents and families, political leaders, and the general public understand the use of ike in tandem with the school catchment area.
